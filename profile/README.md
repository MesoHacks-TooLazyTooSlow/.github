#### In India, we often hear the news about deaths in road accidents. Quite a few times, the ambulance could not reach on time. It is recorded that about 30% of deaths are caused due to delayed ambulances, and this is not a small ratio. Hence, we came up with a solution for this - `AMbulanceüöë`.

## üè•About The Project:
 This project is an alternative to the ambulance, which supports the belief of *"People for the people"*. Further, we can demonstrate it as software connecting people who want to volunteer during mishaps. This project enabled people to come forward and help others. In this project, if a person meets an accident and needs help, then he can use this app, and in two clicks, all the volunteers within a particular radius will receive a text message with the live location of the person. 


## ‚úèÔ∏èHow does it work?
The idea behind this app is that a needy person can get help in two clicks. The people who have this app installed can sign up as volunteers. They need to share only their contact number and name for this and accept a declaration form. After that, they will get registered to the app. 
In case of any emergency, volunteers will receive a text message containing the live location of the person who needs help. We don't want to put any compulsion; thus, it's the volunteer's choice whether to help the person or not.


## üî≠Future of the project
We will look to scale this project. We are planning to create a web application as well for easy access. Further, we want to introduce a reward system for those who volunteer to help regarding which we can collaborate with different companies.
Also, showing the live locations of available volunteers in the application is one of the features we want to integrate into the project so that it will be easy for people to locate a nearby volunteer. 
For instance, there is no business aspect of the project, and we don't want to profit from it. Hence, the generated revenue will be invested in the maintenance and betterment of the software.
