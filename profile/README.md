#### In India, we often hear the news about deaths in road accidents. Quite a few times, the ambulance could not reach on time. It is recorded that about 30% of deaths are caused due to delayed ambulances, and this is not a small ratio. Hence, we came up with a solution for this - `AMbulanceüöë`.

## üè•About The Project:
 This project is an alternative to the ambulance, which supports the belief of *"People for the people"*. Further, we can demonstrate it as software connecting people who want to volunteer during mishaps. This project enabled people to come forward and help others. In this project, if a person meets an accident and needs help, then he can use this app, and in two clicks, all the volunteers within a particular radius will receive a text message. 


## ‚úèÔ∏èHow does it work?
The idea behind this app is that a needy person can get help in two clicks. The people who has this app installed can sign up as volunteers. They need to share only their contact number and name for this and accept a declaration form. After that they will be registered to the app. 
In case of of any emergency, volunteers will recieve a text message

## üî≠Future of the project
We will definetly look for scaling this project. We are planning to create a web-application as well for easy access. Further we want to introduce a reward system for the people who volunteers to help.
Also, showing the live locations of available volunteers in the application is one of the features we want to integrate in the project, so that it will be easy for the people to locate a nearby volunteer.
